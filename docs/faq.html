<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p class="question">Who is the target audience?
</p>
<p class="answer">
This project was created to scratch a personal itch:
I use Linux but I never found a text editor in Unix I was totally
comfortable with. So, I guess the target audience are other
likeminded people who are not into Vim or Emacs but still have
a need for a console-mode text editor. Dit behaves much like
text-entry widgets of most applications, so its learning curve
should be pretty small.
</p>

<p class="question">Where is the documentation?</p>
<p class="answer">There is not a lot of documentation yet.
There are some hints to help you get started in the 
<a href="downloads.html">download</a> page, and... 
well, that's not really documentation but the 
<a href="https://github.com/hishamhm/dit/blob/master/bindings/default">key bindings file</a> knows all the secrets. :)</p>

<p class="question">Some key combinations don't work!</p>
<p class="answer">It could be a lot of things: X or the console driver, the
terminal, ncurses or dit itself. Writing interactive applications
for the Unix console is a frustrating uphill battle. It's impossible to
come up with a configuration that works everywhere, so I made terminal escapes
and keybindings configurable through files loaded at runtime. Take a look at
the files under terminals/ and bindings/ and edit them at your heart's content.

<p class="question">
What does the name 'dit' stand for?
</p>
<p class="answer">

'Dit' is the past participle of the verb <a
href="http://www.wordreference.com/fren/dit">dire</a>, which means "to say", in
French. It's a short, easy to pronounce name that I find very fitting: a text
editor is a tool to "say" things, in writing. It took me an year and a half to
find this name. Before that, the editor's binary was simply called 'e'.
Ironically, only when I took the 'e' out of 'edit', I found a nice word that
could represent the project well.
<br/><br/>

So, no, 'dit' is <i>not</i> an acronym. Especially, it is <i>not</i> a recursive
acronym, although something like "Dit Is a Texteditor" could be easily thought of
after the fact. </p>
